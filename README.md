This presentation delves into BDD concepts using Gerkin, emphasizing its usage and relevance within software development practices.

## BDD ehh?

This segment explains Behavior-driven Development (BDD) as an agile methodology linked to Test Driven Development (TDD) and Domain Driven Design (DDD). It emphasizes the importance of acceptance test criteria and their potential automation.

## What is Gherkin?

## Basic Syntax

The Basic Syntax section illustrates the implementation of privacy information access on a website, covering user requests and expected responses.

## Why should I care?

Highlighting the significance of Gherkin and BDD in software development:

- Documenting features in legacy systems
- Facilitating regression testing
- Serving as a live, verified product requirement specification

## Anti-patterns

This section explores the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle within software development practices.
